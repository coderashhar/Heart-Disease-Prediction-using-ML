# CardioPredict-Ai

The **CardioPredict-Ai** is a machine learning-powered web application that provides a simple and interactive user interface to predict a person's risk of heart disease based on various health metrics and medical attributes.

The app uses a trained **Logistic Regression** model along with a pre-fitted scaler to process user inputs and deliver an instant prediction. 

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Sliders, dropdowns, and number inputs to easily capture patient data.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Click "Predict" to instantly evaluate the risk of heart disease.
- **Comprehensive Medical Inputs**:
  - Age & Sex
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure & Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG Results
  - Maximum Heart Rate
  - Exercise-Induced Angina
  - ST Depression (Oldpeak) and ST Slope
